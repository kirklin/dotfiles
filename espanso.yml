# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  # Personal Information
  - trigger: ";phone"
    replace:

  - trigger: ";mail"
    replace:

  - trigger: ";addr"
    replace: 我的家庭住址

  - trigger: ";officeAddr"
    replace:

  # Coding Snippets
  - trigger: ";log"
    replace: console.log($|$)

  - trigger: ";delay"
    replace: const delay = (ms) => new Promise((res) => setTimeout(res, ms));

  # API Key snippet
  - trigger: ";apikey"
    replace: "sk-"

  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!

  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%m/%d/%Y"

  # Print the output of a shell command
  - trigger: ":shell"
    replace: "{{output}}"
    vars:
      - name: output
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "echo 'Hello from your shell'"
