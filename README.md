# Kirk Lin's Dotfiles

This repository contains my personal dotfiles and setup instructions for zsh and other tools.

## Installation Steps

### 1. Install zsh and Oh My Zsh
Run the following command to install Oh My Zsh:

```bash
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

After installation, update Oh My Zsh and reload your configuration:

```bash
omz update
source ~/.zshrc
```

### 2. Install Starship Prompt

Starship is a fast and highly customizable prompt written in Rust. Install it using Homebrew:

```zsh
brew install starship
```

Add the following line to your .zshrc to initialize Starship:

```zsh
eval "$(starship init zsh)"
```

### 3. Install Useful zsh Plugins

I use the following plugins to enhance the zsh experience:
	- zsh-autosuggestions
	- zsh-completions
	- zsh-syntax-highlighting

Clone these plugins into your Oh My Zsh custom plugins directory:

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-autosuggestions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-autosuggestions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-completions ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-completions
git clone https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh-syntax-highlighting ${ZSH_CUSTOM:-~/.oh-my-zsh/custom}/plugins/zsh-syntax-highlighting
```

## Homebrew Installation Script

This repository includes a script `homebrew-install.sh` to automate the installation of Homebrew and various applications.

### Usage

The script is controlled via command-line flags. Before running, ensure it has execution permissions:

```bash
chmod +x homebrew-install.sh
```

Then, run the script with the desired options:

```bash
./homebrew-install.sh [options]
```

**Options:**

| Flag             | Description                                                   |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c`, `--cli`    | Install command-line interface (CLI) tools.                   |
| `-g`, `--gui`    | Install graphical user interface (GUI) applications (casks).  |
| `-p`, `--proxy`  | Enable proxy (`http://127.0.0.1:7890`) for the session.       |
| `-m`, `--mirror` | Use Chinese mirror (USTC) for Homebrew for faster downloads.  |
| `-h`, `--help`   | Display the help message.                                     |

**Example:**

To install both CLI tools and GUI applications using the Chinese mirror, run:

```bash
./homebrew-install.sh --cli --gui --mirror
```

**Note:** The script will check if Xcode Command Line Tools are installed. If not, it will prompt you to install them first by running `xcode-select --install`.
